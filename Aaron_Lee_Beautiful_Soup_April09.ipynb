    "Hello all! Today we will be taking a look at a very interesting and useful Python library called Beautiful Soup. Beautiful Soup is fundamentally a tool designed to assist users in extracting data from HTML and XML sources through commonly known and used Pythonic idioms. With the help of the Requests Python library, it can also be used to crawl the web and scrape data from online HTML and XML sources. It leverages the nested structure of both HTML and XML files to provide an easily searchable, modifiable, and well parsed document tree. For more information regarding official documentation, please visit https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/. \n",
    "\n",
    "This spotlight assumes that the user has a working understanding of both XML and HTML document structures as well as their applications. If unfamiliar with XML, please consider visiting https://www.howtogeek.com/357092/what-is-an-xml-file-and-how-do-i-open-one/ to bolster or refresh your understanding. Also consider visiting https://study.com/academy/lesson/what-is-an-html-document-structure-types-examples.html for information about HTML.\n",

    "This spotlight will demonstrate many of the most important functions and features of the Beautiful Soup library alongside some interesting applications of it. \n",

    "First, we must confirm that we have the correct packages installed in our respective environment. This can be achieved by running the following lines of code. "

For the homework assignments, you may talk to any other class member or work in groups to discuss the problems <b>in a general way</b>. However, your actual detailed solution must be yours alone.

Your solution should be written by you without the direct aid or help of anyone else. However, we believe that \tcollaboration and team work are important for facilitating learning, so we encourage you \tto discuss problems and general problem approaches (but not actual solutions) with your \tclassmates. If you do have a chat with another student about a homework problem, you \tmust inform us by writing a note on your homework submission (e.g., Bob pointed me to \tthe relevant section for problem 3). The basic rule is that no student should explicitly share a solution with another student (and thereby circumvent the basic learning process), but it is okay to share general approaches, directions, and so on. If you feel like you have an issue that needs clarification, feel free to contact either me or the TA.\n",

For example, many modern big datasets (at least in the NLP realm) are stored in some variant of XML format and Beautiful Soup is an excellent and easy way to extract necessary and important information from them. The simple to use structure and powerful methods provided by the Beautiful Soup library make it an ideal tool for many different applications and I hope that this spotlight has provided some insight and inspiration to you regarding its use.
