    "## Weak Supervision \n",
    "\n",
    "Many traditional machine learning approaches have an insatiable appetite for labeled training data. The key problem of the current common approach of having SMEs (Subject Matter Experts) label large amounts of data is that it is very expensive, especially in specialty fields like medicine. It also poses a privacy risk allowing crowdsourced workers label the data manually. Several different approaches have been studied to alleviate this bottleneck like semi-supervised learning [1], transfer learning [2], multi-task learning [3].[4] and active learning [5]. Weak supervision, however takes a different approach where we leverage the concepts of data programming [6] to unify and model multiple sources of weak labels to create a strong label. Weak labels are obtained via heuristic rules, distant supervision techniques, keyword and/or pattern matches, third-party models, noisy labels from crowd workers, weak classifiers and more.\n"

    "> **Snorkel is a system that combines various sources of weak supervision to learn a generative model to apply labels to a data-set programmatically.**\n",
    "\n",
    "In the work done by Ratner et al in the paper on Snorkel [7] they introduce the concept of Labeling Functions (LFs) as black box snippets of code written by SMEs which are in turn used to label subsets of unlabeled data. Each labeling function is a weak label generator based on the above mentioned methods of obtaining weak labels. Since a single LF can produce less-than-ideal training labels, Snorkel learns a generative model to combine the outputs of multiple LFs in order to generate probabilistic labels. This also solves the heterogeneity problem where multiple weak label sources can either overlap or conflict on a data point making it difficult and cumbersome to consolidate the labels. Ratner et al. also show that using the probabilistic training labels to train a powerful, flexible discriminative model (such as a deep neural network) will generalize beyond the signal expressed in our labeling functions."

    "Thus, we can see that Snorkel is a powerful tool to label unlabeled data. The labeling functions are important aspects of Snorkel and highly dependent on users. Thus, users are responsible for good Labeling functions and a better labelled data-set. Reducing false positives for each labeling function and then improving overall accuracy and coverage would be a good practice for writing labeling functions. Again, we should keep in mind that this is weak supervision, so accuracy of labelling will not be as good as labels by SMEs.\n",
    "\n",
    "So far, we have just used Snorkel's Labeling functions (LFs). Snorkel also has other operators such as Transformation Functions(TFs) and Slicing Functions(SFs). Transformation functions are functions that can be applied to a training data point to create another valid training data point of the same class. TFs are used for data-augmentaton. Slicing functions create slices of the data-set which can be used to check or improve performance over those slices.\n",
    "\n",
    "Snorkel provides various other functionalities too. Snorkel can be used for Recommender System, Information Extraction  and Image classification tasks. Snorkel is compatible with distributed environment via Dask and Spark, which helps it to be easily workable in industrial set-ups. Snorkel can also work in conjunction with crowdsourcing labels to label the dataset.\n",
