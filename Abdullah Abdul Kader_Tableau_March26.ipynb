    "To connect to a datasource click on the tableau icon on the top left and you will have the choice to connect your datasource. Tableau allows you to connect data that is stored in a file (Ex. Excel, PDF), data stored on a server, (Ex. Google Analytics, SQL server, sheets etc). \n",
    "\n",
    "For this tutorial I have used the COVID-19 data from https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14quQPFErG-hlpsrNgYcX85vW7JMMK5X2vNZrafRcH8c/edit?usp=sharing. To follow along, add this spreadsheet to your drive. \n",

    "\n",
    "We can now start building charts by dragging fields from the Data pane and dropping them onto columns and rows.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start by adding \"Country\" from dimensions to columns & \"Cases\" from measures to rows. This will create a bar chart for you by default. You can create different views by going to \"Show me\" on the top right corner.\n",
    "\n",
    "You might notice that the chart on my Sheet 1 shows different \"Sum(cases)\" than the one on your chart. That is because I have created a filter to only sum up the cases reported on the last day. A quick scan of the data will help you understand that the data is incrementally uploaded everyday with the number of cumulative cases/deaths. We will discuss calculated fields in the upcoming section."

    "\n",
    "While you can create a number of different visualizations using Tableau, my personal favorite is the geographical visualization. Tableau will generate latitude and longitude if you have cities, states or countries in your dataset. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the COVID-19 dataset we are using longitude and latitude are already provided. We can pop them in just like I have done in Sheet 2 and add the \"cases\" to the color marks. You now have a geographical visualization. Sheet 3 shows just a different view you can create using Tableau (check \"Show me\")\n",

    "### 5. Dig deeper with filters and calculated fields\n",
    "\n",
    "With filters and calculated we can get a little bit fancy. \n",
    "\n",
    "##### Calculated fields \n",
    "\n",
    "Since the dataset we have is reporting cumulative cases for each day, using the \"Cases\" field directly would not be accurate when calculating sum of cases. Sum of cases would default to adding up the cases reported everyday. \n",
    "\n",
    "So we create a filter using a calculated field as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "                IF [Date] = [Latest Date] then \"Latest\"\n",
    "                ELSE \"Not Latest\"\n",
    "                END\n",
    "                \n",
    "Since we have a field called \"Latest Date\" we can create a filter using that. This is the filter you see in the Sheet 1 where I am only visualizing the latest date.\n",
    "\n",
    "Likewise, I have used calculated field for \"Deaths\". The dataset doesn't explicitly provide the number of deaths so we calculate is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "                IF [Case Type] = \"Deaths\" THEN [Cases]\n",
    "                END\n",
    "                \n",
    "Latest deaths is similar to latest cases and we also create a field for percent difference that I have used in Sheets 8 & 8(2)\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Filters\n",
    "\n",
    "Tableau has inbuilt functionality to filter your data. The one that I use most frequently is the \"Top\" filter which allows me to filter the top N rows based on a field.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Sheet 1 I have used the \"Top\" filter to filter top 25 countries with most cases. To access the filter, right click on \"Country\" in your columns and select filter. You will see the option \"Top\". There are also filters based on range etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, you can also filters to any view to filter by date range, countries and any other field. Filters also make your views more interactive. "
