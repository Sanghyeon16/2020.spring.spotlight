    "Whoosh is a fast, search library implemented in python. It is an alternative to pylucene and does not have the dependency on having Java installed. It allows indexing of structured or free-form data and then use simple or complex search queries to find matching documents. It can be used to add search functionality to applications and websites. Every part of how Whoosh works can be extended or replaced to meet your needs exactly. It is highly extensible allowing extending or replacing any part of the functionality including indexing, parsing of queries, and the fields stored in index.\n"

A field is a piece of information for each document in the index, such as its title or text content. Fields can either be indexed, implying their value will be searched or stored meaning value will be returned with the results but not searched. Whoosh has several predefined field types including TEXT (indexed), STORED (stored but not indexed), KEYWORD, ID, NUMERIC, DATETIME and BOOLEAN. "

The downsize is that cute and blonde Provine may just be too sweet and innocent looking to step into Allison Hayes\\' size 50 shoes. This role really needed someone with an amount of smoldering sex appeal; Provine is more the girl next door type. She may have taken and done this role to prove she could be sexy, but the material lets her down. Lou Costello, however, proves he can do a movie without Bud Abbott feeding him lines and he even interjects a dramatic role in some of his scenes when he not turning to Gale Gordon as his front man for gags. Gordon, however, establishes that all he can be is blustery, perturbed and pushy, much the same character he creates later on \"The Lucy Show.\" Charles Lane also plays the same role in everything he does: a straight man, and his screen time is limited. The special effects are convincing for the time, but I would have liked Dorothy to have been a little more than cheesecake and dressing and at least have been allowed to become dangerous. As the movie\\'s lead character, she takes second billing to Costello who is in all of the movie with Dorothy several times vanishing like a sub-plot. The whole movie put together just can\\'t decide if it\\'s supposed to be science fiction, a comedy or just a parody of the Allison Hayes classic. There\\'s a lot of good scenes, some very funny humor and some very ridiculous camp that affects the rest of the film. Still, I do like this movie for it\\'s empowerment of women; there\\'s not enough movies out there like this one. If this movie had a chance to be remade today, I\\'d highly recommend Courtney Cox and Jason Alexander in the lead roles and allow me to completely re-write the original script.

    "Whoosh also has the capability to suggest corrections for mistyped words. It does this by returning words from the index that are close to the mis-typed word. The **whoosh.spelling.Corrector.suggest()** method can be used for this. The suggestions can be done using the indexed words, which causes the suggestions to be tailored to the content of the documents. Another way of suggestions is to use a fixed word list to search for suggestions"

    "## Summary\n",
    "- Whoosh provides a pure python search library that can be used to add search functionalities to application.\n",
    "- Whoosh can be used as an alternative to pylucene when possible providing better integration, avoiding external dependency on Java and JVM, and faster customization if code modifications are required to add additional functionalities.\n",
    "- Whoosh provides a wide list of features for searching and indexing, including word corrections, fuzzy-term queries, phrase-queries, highlighting queried text etc.\n",
    "- Whoosh is highly customizable, allowing easily extending or replacing query parsing, scoring, indexing with custom implementations.\n",
    "- On the downside, the pure python nature does add a performance overhead compared to other libraries. Also pylucene is built on lucene which has a wide developer community and a richer feature list than whoosh."
