Some common pre-processing tasks are punctuation removal, tokenization, stemming, lemmatization etc. All of these can be performed with the help of the 're' module. Even though other libraries exist which make such tasks a lot easier, the advantage that the 're' module offers is the flexibility to design our own rules using regexes. For example, instead of using the predefined Porter stemmer available in Python, we can build our own stemmer after having studied the data relevant to our IR task. This notebook will demonstrate through simple examples the functionality provided by the re module and how we can customize them for our IR specific task.
